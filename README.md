# Bellabeat-Devices-DataAnalysis

Bellabeat-Devices-DataAnalysis is one of the capstone projects of Google data analytics program.
In the scenario, I am  a junior data analyst working for the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, 
a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, 
but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, 
cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help 
unlock new growth opportunities for the company. I chose the bellabeat app as the smart device that I am going to analyze.
The insights that I discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company.
